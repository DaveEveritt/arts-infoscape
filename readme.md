# Infoscape

A 2002 experimental "proof of concept" web-delivered 3D visualisation interface for multiple information sources originally using VRML and being converted to X3D.

The data was about arts- and disability-related organisations in the East Midlands, U.K. and received Arts Council England funding from 2003-4.

in 2020 the aim is to update it to current X3D code.

## TO DO

- [ ] update all XHTML to HTML5
- [ ] fix duplicated "info.css"
- [ ] recreate "details.html", "disarts.html" in a new data structure
- [ ] refactor pop-up windows into in-page modals
- [ ] complete VRML-X3D conversionâ€¦ and break this up into spearate jobs
