Again it is hard to judge as I was not able to speak to a disabled participant directly. However I think it is relevant that when asked for a disabled participant I was given the name of a non disabled person who is primarily involved through her work as a day centre officer.<br /><br /><b>Staff: Not Disability Led</b> - Arts and disability. The work is not necessarily issue based, its about access to the arts.<br /><br /><b>Participant: Disability Arts</b> - Arts and disability because the disability is not important except in looking at ways to access and making it meaningful. It is about involvement and individuals not about disability.<br /><br /><b>Linked: Arts And Disability</b>- Both really, another area is about providing job opportunities for disabled artists, not just about giving disabled people the opportunity to create but also to offer facilitative roles.<br /><hr style="color:#ffffff;" /><b>Participant: </b>They are always there in support and can be used in so many different ways. We can call Artlink and say we have got a group who need support, they will come and share ideas. They are the first port of call if we are looking for artists or writers. We did not know anything about this area, they are a source of contacts and we know that any artists or groups they mention will be appropriate. Also Artlink can help with finding and applying for funds which we within Social Services cannot apply for.<br /><hr /><br /></body></html><?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?><!DOCTYPE html	PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"	 "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><head><title>Details</title><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/styles/info.css" /></head><body><h2>Bamboozle Theatre Company</h2><b>Overall: </b>I would say around 35% is informed by the groups needs<br /><br /><b>Staff: Not Disability Led</b> - Arts and disability, because Bamboozle run workshops in different art forms in which people with disabilities take part.<br /><br /><b>Participant: </b> - Both the same aren't they?<br /><br /><b>Linked: Disability Arts</b>- Arts &amp; disability because it's not disabled arts but the arts activities Bamboozle provide engage disabled people.<br /><hr style="color:#ffffff;" /><b>Participant: </b>Because with Sue and Christopher they talk about the work, get up and do it!<br /><hr /><br /></body></html><?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?><!DOCTYPE html	PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"	 "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><head><title>Details</title><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/styles/info.css" /></head><body><h2>City Arts</h2><b>Staff: Not Disability Led</b> - Work with artists to find out their own abilities and development.<br /><br /><b>Participant: Disability Arts</b> - An artist who is disabled.<br /><br /><b>Linked: Arts And Disability</b>- Both.

Pretty Nevasia seems to take control of what she gets out of the workshop.<br /><br /><b>Staff: Disability Led</b> - Arts &amp; Disability. We aim to introduce and provide arts related projects to groups of people with variable disabilities the opportunity to experience and develop their creative potential and artistic ability. We work in the community and with the community with the main aim being that this is an opportunity for everyone to share their interest in the arts. <br /><br /><b>Participant: </b> - Arts workshop: (Pretty didn't really comment too much on this but I gather she didn't consider the work to be 'disability arts', she just views it as participating in arts workshops).<br /><br /><b>Linked: Disability Arts</b>- Arts &amp; Disability.

Not only is the organisation run by disabled people ( mostly voluntarily) but the sessions , discussions and training are all run by disabled trainers also.<br /><br /><b>Staff: Disability Led</b> - Neither, as it is training and professional services for disabled artists in the arts. Some are disabled artists, some are disabled people. We have a wide range of members in terms of their political and artistic viewpoint.<br /><br /><b>Participant: Arts And Disability</b> - For me the organisation is about arts and disability, but there is scope within for Disability Arts also. My own expression through art would include Disability Art but also goes beyond it too.<br /><br /><b>Linked: </b>- I wouldn't draw a distinction. The issue is one of effectiveness, and contribution to an overall picture.<br /><hr style="color:#ffffff;" /><b>Participant: </b>I don't have much experience of other organisations but I think what seems to stand apart is its focus on professional development.<br /><hr /><br /></body></html><?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?><!DOCTYPE html	PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"	 "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><head><title>Details</title><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/styles/info.css" /></head><body><h2>First Movement</h2><b>Overall: </b>In the individual sessions the work is often disabled led but this is on an experimental basis and I am not clear how much control the participants have over the development of their ideas. In terms of long term strategic planning the organisation is looking into developing a disabled led approach. <br /><br /><b>Staff: Not Disability Led</b> - It is arts and disability because the work is not culturally led by disabled people and does not form necessarily part of that culture, so by its very nature it cannot be disability arts. <br /><br /><b>Linked: Arts And Disability</b>- Both. Disability arts means using artistic expression to describe what its like to be disabled or to advocate political action. First Movement work with people with learning disabilities and help them to express their own creativity. A lot of the work is initiated by people with learning disabilities expressing their own visions not necessarily their experience of being disabled.<br /><br /><hr /></body></html><?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?><!DOCTYPE html	PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"	 "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><head><title>Details</title><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/styles/info.css" /></head><body><h2>Fourth Wall Theatre Company</h2><b>Overall: </b>All the work is disabled led as such a high proportion of the management group and facilitators have disabilities. Also the whole idea came from the Mental Health Steering Group and out of World Mental Health Day.<br />The brief of the group is very specific and caters mainly for mental health user, even though there is an open door policy.<br />This is very much what I would called disability arts but it seems also to cross over into personal development. I do take the point of Sue though, and see the circular relationship between disability arts and arts and disability. I think as this organisation matures it will become more arts orientated -at the moment they are very much exploring.<br />I think this is an interesting organisation as a 'fledgling' organisation - but pulling in over 100 disabled participants in a year is not bad at all when compared with more established organisations. There is definitely a need for this organisation, but I also take Dave's point about its vulnerability, which to remain disabled led it must surely try and weather (?) We'll see how things go in the next year.<br /><br /><b>Staff: Disability Led</b> - Personally I think it's a circular thing, disability and arts/arts and disability, I think it's a circular interaction -and that's just how it is the whole time. Because the management committee is largely made up of disabled people and because we have creative skills as well everything just flows round and interacts full circle. It's the whole thing, rather than one way or the other.<br />With participants I think the workshops are facilitated to promote a disability and art perspective, rather than arts and disability because we want to encourage people to bring in both sides of the equation and sometimes people are embarrassed about their disabilities.<br /><br /><b>Participant: Arts And Disability</b> - Both. Disability Arts in that the piece we want to make is about people's mental health experiences. Arts and disability because we are all learning new artistic skills.<br /><br /><b>Linked: </b>- <br /><hr style="color:#ffffff;" /><b>Participant: </b>I think because it comes so much from the personal and people are experiencing and writing about the problems they have as part of their way of life.<br /><hr /><br /></body></html><?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?><!DOCTYPE html	PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"	 "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><head><title>Details</title><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/styles/info.css" /></head><body><h2>High Peak Community Arts</h2><b>Overall: </b>I think the work of High Peak Arts is disabled led in its own way, certainly the needs of disabled participants in the arts are central to provision, the provision of projects being tailored in a way that isn't usually seen as affordable by other providers - thanks perhaps to social services input into High Peak's funding pot. (Although, the geography also influences dramatically how projects are provided). But to have a project especially designed around your own individual needs is of course 100% successful for those involved.<br />The fact that you have to be referred into Arts Exchange by social workers is a bit of a sticking point for me - although I'm assured nobody has complained about this. I wonder who is excluded because of this - quite a fair proportion of people with disabilities. I think this fact effects the character of the work High Peak do and although it is innovative in some ways, gives in a very institutionalised feel in others...<br />How Spectrum Arts takes over, after the participants have used up their two project eligibility is another question. I think they will be successful, but with steady input from High Peak Arts.<br />The concept of disabled workshop leaders or proactive disabled people seemed a bit alien to the organisation - which still seemed very much to be non-disabled providing for disabled, though talking to Gillian (disabled participant) it seemed that Spectrum members were running/had run at least one project in a school.<br />There was what seemed a genuine desire to have more disabled people involved in provision within the organisation, but some difficulty in reconciling the fact that there might be a need for positive discrimination for people with disabilities to make contacts for future working relationships to really flower. Without proper advertising encouraging disabled applicants and showing awareness of their needs, the fact that no-one who is disabled has applied for a job might not be a reflection of demographics or where people live!!!!<br /><br /><b>Staff: Not Disability Led</b> - Probably Arts and disability, if disability arts means always looking at the arts through the political standpoint of disability. Sometimes our participants make art about their disability, but sometimes not, more often not - its about their own freedom of choice and personal expression. So, yes, definitely more arts and disability than disability arts.<br />If people do choose to make work about their disability I guess it could have a positive effect on how disability is perceived, even if all it does is cause the person experiencing the work to go - god, a disabled person did this. Sometimes its interesting for the family members of participants who don't believe that their son/daughter, aunt/uncle or whatever could produce something 'as good as' what they are looking at/reading or whatever. Sometimes giving someone a new positive image of a person they thought knew, can be very radical.<br /><br /><b>Participant: Disability Arts</b> - Arts and disability - a long way second. Art Exchange and Spectrum are not about disability in the sense of basket weaving - it goes way beyond that. What we do at Spectrum and Art Exchange is quality its really skilled work.<br /><br /><b>Linked: Arts And Disability</b>- Both. They are a provider of generalised arts projects, but they have a skill in specialist arts provision - they are very disability aware.<br /><hr style="color:#ffffff;" /><b>Participant: </b>I would say the quality of the tutors and the small groups. Its very flexible really, depending upon what you want or need. Some people have workers go into their own homes and have one-to-one tuition, whereas others prefer the social side of small groups and want to get out of the house. The projects you do are tailored for your needs, so that's really unique I guess.<br /><hr /><br /></body></html><?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?><!DOCTYPE html	PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"	 "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><head><title>Details</title><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/styles/info.css" /></head><body><h2>Indigo Dance Group (Salamanda Tandem)</h2><b>Staff: Not Disability Led</b> - Arts and disability.

New perspectives feels that the organisation is not in a position to make cultural or political statements about disability. They feel the work carried out by them is with all areas of the community.

The organisations focus on supporting groups in achieving their own goals is adhered to with passion.<br /><br /><b>Staff: Not Disability Led</b> - Inadvertently some projects have become Disability Arts projects. For example mental health writing projects led by a disabled writer and the groups work is very much about their experiences. They work as a group to build individuals confidence. There is a principle of people owning the work and making the decisions.<br /><br /><b>Participant: </b> - These are not terms we particularly identify with. It is hard because as people with mental health issues it is not obvious we are disabled so we do not necessarily identify with the labels, but do acknowledge an empathy with other disabled people. Some of the work might be classed as disability art as it is very personal to the experiences members here have been through. The book of journeys which is being published this year is dedicated to a member who lost his life last year. The group spent the summers barge holiday writing poetry, prose and short stories and taking photographs for the book.<br /><br /><b>Linked: Disability Arts</b>- Arts and disability because the organisations primary thrust is arts work rather than disability focussed.<br /><hr style="color:#ffffff;" /><b>Participant: </b>People express are the only arts organisation I have really been in contact with, but we all seem to work well together.
