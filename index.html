  <h1>Infoscape: pilot project (2002)</h1>
  <h2 style="border: 0; font-size: smaller; text-align: center; margin-top: 0;">3D data visualisation for arts & disability activity in the East Midlands</h2>

  <h2>What is Infoscape?</h2>
	
  <p>An experimental overview visualisation for large amounts of information, using simple web-delivered 3D. This 2002 <cite>proof of concept</cite> project demonstrated that the system was usable for data about arts- and disability-related organisations in the East Midlands, U.K. and received Arts Council England funding from 2003-4.</p>
	
  <p>As well as quantitative data (location, finance, connections with related organisations, etc.), contextual qualitative data was added from extensive face-to-face interviews gathered personal accounts from participants to board members. This gave a realistic human perspective to each organisation.</p>
  
  <p>The idea was to provide a single interface for users to see at a glance the connectivity of each organisation, and (by clicking on an organisation’s sphere) read text from the interviews in a separate window. The data behind the system can be updated, and viewed in other ways.</p>
	
  <p>The coloured shapes represent each disability arts organisation, with connecting lines representing their relationships to each other. The smaller shapes represent work done with external organisations. Extra information is carried by the <a href="key-geographic.html">shapes and colours of each object.</a> The pilot project took 2 years to develop from the <a href="ifs-proposal/">original proposal</a>, and ended in Autumn 2003 with a <a href="documents/infoscape_pilot_report.doc">brief report</a> (Word format).</p>
	
  <p>
  	There are two maps, each with a key to colour and shape:<br>
  	a <a href="vrml/t1.html"><strong>geographical map</strong></a> (described above) with a <a href="key-geographic.html">colour/shape key</a><br>
  	a <a href="vrml/b2.html"><strong>3D financial graph</strong></a> with <a href="key-financial.html">financial key</a> and preset data views.
	</p>
  
  <h3>2020 update: convert to X3D:</h3>

    <strong>NOTE:</strong> the <a href="http://doc.instantreality.org/tools/x3d_encoding_converter/">VRML to X3D conversion</a> is incomplete, so nothing usable is showing yet<br>

  <h2>About the data</h2>

  <p>You can view <em>all data and comments</em> gathered during interviews (only some of this appears in the pop-ups) in two long pages:<br>

   <a href="disarts.html">Disability-led, disability arts or art &amp; disability?</a></h3>

    <p>You will need a <b>VRML plug-in</b> - choose the recommended one from the table below, then spend some time learning the navigation controls by experiment.</p>
  	
    <p>Each plug-in has various controls of its own, available from within the browser window. Use the <cite>Study</cite> (default) or <cite>Fly</cite> mode at first (rather than <cite>Walk</cite>) - you'll find it more controllable. <strong>If you get lost</strong>, use <cite>Restore</cite> to return to the original view, or choose a pre-set view from the <cite>View</cite> control.</p>
