There is a questionnaire for all attendees and linked organisations and 27a do listen to what they would like to do. The informality of the space is also unique, it is not seen as a day centre but as a typical arts venue. It is not intimidating, this is very valuable and does encourage people to drop in.<br /><br /><b>Linked: </b>The way the organisation works with disabled people, a lot of the work has upfront or hidden messages about the lives of disabled people. They get disabled peoples work showcased in a wide range of centres and in other arts events for example in film festivals.|27a do a lot of work with people with learning disabilities and people with mental health disabilities , they provide a safe and welcoming space helping people to feel confident.|We need places like 27a who are helping to breakdown some of the barriers of stigmatism.<br /><br /><b>Participant: </b>They care more about the people who come here, they don't treat people as disabled, they talk to and treat everybody alike.<br /><br /></body></html>
