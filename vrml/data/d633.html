The training videos as a complete package also point towards real disabled led creativity.<br /><br /><b>Staff: Not Disability Led</b> - Arts and disability in the main. We encourage Disability Arts but it has to come from the individuals, you can foster it but not force the choice.<br /><br /><b>Participant: Disability Arts</b> - Arts and disability, because we do our own thing, we do what we enjoy.<br /><br /><b>Linked: Neither/don't  Know</b>- Disability Art. 27a are keen that the people they work with come up with the projects and ideas themselves. They work with disabled people to create art which covers lots of different mediums.<br /><br /><hr /><b>Participant: </b>They care more about the people who come here, they don't treat people as disabled, they talk to and treat everybody alike.<br /><br /></body></html>
