</head><body><h2>Fourth Wall Theatre Company</h2><b>Overall: </b>All the work is disabled led as such a high proportion of the management group and facilitators have disabilities. Also the whole idea came from the Mental Health Steering Group and out of World Mental Health Day.<br>The brief of the group is very specific and caters mainly for mental health user, even though there is an open door policy.<br>This is very much what I would called disability arts but it seems also to cross over into personal development. I do take the point of Sue though, and see the circular relationship between disability arts and arts and disability. I think as this organisation matures it will become more arts orientated -at the moment they are very much exploring.<br>I think this is an interesting organisation as a 'fledgling' organisation - but pulling in over 100 disabled participants in a year is not bad at all when compared with more established organisations. There is definitely a need for this organisation, but I also take Dave's point about its vulnerability, which to remain disabled led it must surely try and weather (?) We'll see how things go in the next year.<br /><br /><b>Staff: Disability Led</b> - Personally I think it's a circular thing, disability and arts/arts and disability, I think it's a circular interaction -and that's just how it is the whole time. Because the management committee is largely made up of disabled people and because we have creative skills as well everything just flows round and interacts full circle. It's the whole thing, rather than one way or the other.<br>With participants I think the workshops are facilitated to promote a disability and art perspective, rather than arts and disability because we want to encourage people to bring in both sides of the equation and sometimes people are embarrassed about their disabilities.<br /><br /><b>Participant: Arts And Disability</b> - Both. Disability Arts in that the piece we want to make is about people's mental health experiences. Arts and disability because we are all learning new artistic skills.<br /><br /><b>Linked: </b>- <br /><br /><hr /><b>Participant: </b>I think because it comes so much from the personal and people are experiencing and writing about the problems they have as part of their way of life.<br /><br /></body></html>
