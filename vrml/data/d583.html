</head><body><h2>People Express</h2><b>Overall: </b>All the work which involves disabled individuals linked to disability groups is genuinely disabled led. The organisations focus on supporting groups in achieving their own goals is adhered to with passion.<br /><br /><b>Staff: Not Disability Led</b> - Inadvertently some projects have become Disability Arts projects. For example mental health writing projects led by a disabled writer and the groups work is very much about their experiences. They work as a group to build individuals confidence. There is a principle of people owning the work and making the decisions.<br /><br /><b>Participant: </b> - These are not terms we particularly identify with. It is hard because as people with mental health issues it is not obvious we are disabled so we do not necessarily identify with the labels, but do acknowledge an empathy with other disabled people. Some of the work might be classed as disability art as it is very personal to the experiences members here have been through. The book of journeys which is being published this year is dedicated to a member who lost his life last year. The group spent the summers barge holiday writing poetry, prose and short stories and taking photographs for the book.<br /><br /><b>Linked: Disability Arts</b>- Arts and disability because the organisations primary thrust is arts work rather than disability focussed.<br /><br /><hr /><b>Participant: </b>People express are the only arts organisation I have really been in contact with, but we all seem to work well together. Everyone is really friendly and with their help we are now able to raise money ourselves. People Express have helped to move us on to becoming more independent and building our confidence. Our success feeds their success and visa versa, the relationship is very equal.<br /><br /></body></html>
