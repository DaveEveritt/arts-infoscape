Again it is hard to judge as I was not able to speak to a disabled participant directly. However I think it is relevant that when asked for a disabled participant I was given the name of a non disabled person who is primarily involved through her work as a day centre officer.<br /><br /><b>Staff: Not Disability Led</b> - Arts and disability. The work is not necessarily issue based, its about access to the arts.<br /><br /><b>Participant: Disability Arts</b> - Arts and disability because the disability is not important except in looking at ways to access and making it meaningful. It is about involvement and individuals not about disability.<br /><br /><b>Linked: Arts And Disability</b>- Both really, another area is about providing job opportunities for disabled artists, not just about giving disabled people the opportunity to create but also to offer facilitative roles.<br /><br /><hr /><b>Participant: </b>They are always there in support and can be used in so many different ways. We can call Artlink and say we have got a group who need support, they will come and share ideas. They are the first port of call if we are looking for artists or writers. We did not know anything about this area, they are a source of contacts and we know that any artists or groups they mention will be appropriate. Also Artlink can help with finding and applying for funds which we within Social Services cannot apply for.<br /><br /></body></html>
