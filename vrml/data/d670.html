New perspectives feels that the organisation is not in a position to make cultural or political statements about disability. They feel the work carried out by them is with all areas of the community. For example with disabled people, young children or elderly people. There is a broad range of groups who New Perspectives work with.<br /><br /><b>Participant: Disability Arts</b> - Arts and disability, I like to be involved as I am disabled.<br /><br /><b>Linked: Disability Arts</b>- It is Arts and disability as different aspects incorporating introductory theatre experience workshops are included We are able to use Richards expertise, contacts to work and we have done this from feedback from disabled participants.<br /><br /><hr /><b>Participant: </b>New Perspectives is very special, because sometimes I love to do music, dance or drama and I get to do a lot different stuff. I go to college and this fits in with that.<br /><br /></body></html>
