Pretty Nevasia seems to take control of what she gets out of the workshop.<br /><br /><b>Staff: Disability Led</b> - Arts & Disability. We aim to introduce and provide arts related projects to groups of people with variable disabilities the opportunity to experience and develop their creative potential and artistic ability. We work in the community and with the community with the main aim being that this is an opportunity for everyone to share their interest in the arts. <br /><br /><b>Participant: </b> - Arts workshop: (Pretty didn't really comment too much on this but I gather she didn't consider the work to be 'disability arts', she just views it as participating in arts workshops).<br /><br /><b>Linked: Disability Arts</b>- Arts & Disability. The projects are about art. The groups are integrated and all share and develop their creativity through various art forms.<br /><br /><hr /><b>Participant: </b>I am able to put my ideas into the work, with the workshop leader helping and encouraging me and showing me how I need to go about doing what I want to do, also I like the venue.<br /><br /></body></html>
