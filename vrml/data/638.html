Bamboozle hold onto the notion that they go into the Theatre or another space 'out of school' because of restrictions that a school has. The Haymarket Theatre in Leicester is far better equipped to cater for the needs of Bamboozle with regards technical support such as light & sound. The environment is perfect for interaction with the various groups. For example Bamboozle has recently been told that one particular school who has been attending the workshops for a number of years has had an enormous long term effect on the students with regards confidence. One student had fear of heights and trusting herself, by the end of the project she had actually climbed a number of steps to the top of a ladder. Because of this her confidence has grown and a year on is still happy to go 'that bit further' Another unique part of the way Bamboozle's work is that the students get to mix with one another not only in the theatre but over lunch and working as a team<br /><br /><b>Board: </b>The way in which Sue & Chris engage everybody that takes part in their workshops. Nobody is left out and even in a group with extreme mixed abilities, Bamboozle adapt their work to make sure no-one is left out. Unique!<br /><br /><b>Linked: </b>The work that Bamboozle do especially with children with profound and multiple disabilities, includes the parents and carers and even brothers and sisters. They are very sensitive to the people outside the person with the disability and I found that a most moving experience<br /><br /><b>Participant: </b>Because with Sue and Christopher they talk about the work, get up and do it!<br /><br /></body></html>
