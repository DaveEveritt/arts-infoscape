It is possible to find training for disabled people in work related issues but not for disabled people working in the arts as self employed. The training available for self employed people is often not suitable or accessible for disabled people.<br /><br /><b>Board: </b>The organisation is run by disabled people for disabled with members all in a similar situation who are aware of each others needs and experiences.<br /><br /><b>Linked: </b>It is focused on developing artists who have the skills and experience to work in this field.<br /><br /><b>Participant: </b>I don't have much experience of other organisations but I think what seems to stand apart is its focus on professional development.<br /><br /></body></html>
