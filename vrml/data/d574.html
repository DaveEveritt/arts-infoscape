(Although, the geography also influences dramatically how projects are provided). But to have a project especially designed around your own individual needs is of course 100% successful for those involved.<br>The fact that you have to be referred into Arts Exchange by social workers is a bit of a sticking point for me - although I'm assured nobody has complained about this. I wonder who is excluded because of this - quite a fair proportion of people with disabilities. I think this fact effects the character of the work High Peak do and although it is innovative in some ways, gives in a very institutionalised feel in others...<br>How Spectrum Arts takes over, after the participants have used up their two project eligibility is another question. I think they will be successful, but with steady input from High Peak Arts.<br>The concept of disabled workshop leaders or proactive disabled people seemed a bit alien to the organisation - which still seemed very much to be non-disabled providing for disabled, though talking to Gillian (disabled participant) it seemed that Spectrum members were running/had run at least one project in a school.<br>There was what seemed a genuine desire to have more disabled people involved in provision within the organisation, but some difficulty in reconciling the fact that there might be a need for positive discrimination for people with disabilities to make contacts for future working relationships to really flower. Without proper advertising encouraging disabled applicants and showing awareness of their needs, the fact that no-one who is disabled has applied for a job might not be a reflection of demographics or where people live!!!!<br /><br /><b>Staff: Not Disability Led</b> - Probably Arts and disability, if disability arts means always looking at the arts through the political standpoint of disability. Sometimes our participants make art about their disability, but sometimes not, more often not - its about their own freedom of choice and personal expression. So, yes, definitely more arts and disability than disability arts.<br>If people do choose to make work about their disability I guess it could have a positive effect on how disability is perceived, even if all it does is cause the person experiencing the work to go - god, a disabled person did this. Sometimes its interesting for the family members of participants who don't believe that their son/daughter, aunt/uncle or whatever could produce something 'as good as' what they are looking at/reading or whatever. Sometimes giving someone a new positive image of a person they thought knew, can be very radical.<br /><br /><b>Participant: Disability Arts</b> - Arts and disability - a long way second. Art Exchange and Spectrum are not about disability in the sense of basket weaving - it goes way beyond that. What we do at Spectrum and Art Exchange is quality its really skilled work.<br /><br /><b>Linked: Arts And Disability</b>- Both. They are a provider of generalised arts projects, but they have a skill in specialist arts provision - they are very disability aware.<br /><br /><hr /><b>Participant: </b>I would say the quality of the tutors and the small groups. Its very flexible really, depending upon what you want or need. Some people have workers go into their own homes and have one-to-one tuition, whereas others prefer the social side of small groups and want to get out of the house. The projects you do are tailored for your needs, so that's really unique I guess.<br /><br /></body></html>
