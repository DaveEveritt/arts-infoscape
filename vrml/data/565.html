There's a lot of creative art work goes on but not a lot that is managed by and involved with the actual users.<br /><br /><b>Board: </b>It is led by mental health users. The group that is serves, and not by anyone with preconceptions of what mental health is or how it should be treated or portrayed.<br /><br /><b>Participant: </b>I think because it comes so much from the personal and people are experiencing and writing about the problems they have as part of their way of life.<br /><br /></body></html>
