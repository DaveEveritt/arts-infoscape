Our philosophy is that people have a right to access to the arts. We are people centred creatively, we are not about imposing but about creative problem solving.<br /><br /><b>Board: </b>Artlink is unique in Lincolnshire - it's the only agency specifically working to the needs of people with disabilities. Artlink can create new projects or respond to the request of groups or individuals. The work is, more often than not, delivered directly by Artlink and therefore very personal.<br /><br /><b>Linked: </b>Artlink has been around for a decade or so, there role over the last 2 - 3 years has changed, they are currently re-inventing themselves. Their main role from 10 years ago as an advocate for inclusive ways of working has now been incorporated into the mainstream arts organisations practices too. They have seen the mainstream catch up.|Artlink are focussed on understanding the needs and aspirations of those generally outside the mainstream, those deemed disadvantaged or excluded. Whereas other arts organisations have a wider constituency.. Artlink provide a voice for their constituency. <br /><br /><b>Participant: </b>They are always there in support and can be used in so many different ways. We can call Artlink and say we have got a group who need support, they will come and share ideas. They are the first port of call if we are looking for artists or writers. We did not know anything about this area, they are a source of contacts and we know that any artists or groups they mention will be appropriate. Also Artlink can help with finding and applying for funds which we within Social Services cannot apply for.<br /><br /></body></html>
