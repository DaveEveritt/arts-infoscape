Of course the Arts Exchange makes us different.<br /><br /><b>Board: </b>Unique partly because we are the only arts organisation serving the High Peak, but also because the projects we do are very innovative and the lottery funded photographic and video suite we operate is a valuable resource for the High Peak and surrounding areas. Also unique because of the Arts Exchange and Arts Exchange Plus. Combine these resources and projects with the way the organisation has adapted and evolved from the original concept of arts provision - with hands on arts workers - to become a more enabling, fundraising, administrative organisation providing in a different way. I think the way that we personally know every freelancer that works for us also makes this organisation unique.<br /><br /><b>Linked: </b>High Peak Arts is unique because it has a specific resource centre focussed on the needs of people with disabilities.<br /><br /><b>Participant: </b>I would say the quality of the tutors and the small groups. Its very flexible really, depending upon what you want or need. Some people have workers go into their own homes and have one-to-one tuition, whereas others prefer the social side of small groups and want to get out of the house. The projects you do are tailored for your needs, so that's really unique I guess.<br /><br /></body></html>
