Participants know they will get not only a good artistic experience but also a good personal experience from working with the artist.<br /><br /><b>Board: </b>Because of the way it empowers people within the arts and practices it's equal opportunities policy to the letter.<br /><br /><b>Linked: </b>Because it's arts made fun! The workshop leaders always communicate with the participants and include everyone. Mantle also go out to the clubs rather than expect us to go there<br /><br /><b>Participant: </b>Everyone is good and nice, I like what we do.<br /><br /></body></html>
