In terms of long term strategic planning the organisation is looking into developing a disabled led approach. <br /><br /><b>Staff: Not Disability Led</b> - It is arts and disability because the work is not culturally led by disabled people and does not form necessarily part of that culture, so by its very nature it cannot be disability arts. <br /><br /><b>Linked: Arts And Disability</b>- Both. Disability arts means using artistic expression to describe what its like to be disabled or to advocate political action. First Movement work with people with learning disabilities and help them to express their own creativity. A lot of the work is initiated by people with learning disabilities expressing their own visions not necessarily their experience of being disabled.<br /><br /><hr /></body></html>
