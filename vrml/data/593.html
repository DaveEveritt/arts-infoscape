We allow work across a huge range of arts forms to come together as chosen by the people involved. So the fusions of work that take place can be between performance, visual, media based arts and uses of new technology. So instead of us saying ' We are a drama company we do drama you will fit into this' , we actually mould and shape the arts form around what people want to do.<br>The other thing that makes us unique is that all our work is based on experiencing and experimenting at the same time so things that evolve have to be new things. You are not starting from trying to create something within a mould that you have already looked at.<br /><br /><b>Board: </b>First Movement have a unique way of working with people with learning disabilities which is immersive and completely experiential. They use a unique combination of different artforms including new media and live art. It is also different because with their client group they are inclusive and responsive.<br /><br /><b>Linked: </b>The way First Movement work with people with learning disabilities is exemplary, they are always looking for ways to enable people with learning disabilities to express themselves and draw them into the creative work they do. Another strong aspect is the way they are using new and digital technology to enable people to express themselves and to link up with groups from other parts of the region. They are looking to set up a virtual room which is worked on by different groups across the country all working at the same time.<br /><br /></body></html>
