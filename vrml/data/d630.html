</head><body><h2>Fased In The Arts</h2><b>Overall: </b>All the work is led 100% by disabled people. Not only is the organisation run by disabled people ( mostly voluntarily) but the sessions , discussions and training are all run by disabled trainers also.<br /><br /><b>Staff: Disability Led</b> - Neither, as it is training and professional services for disabled artists in the arts. Some are disabled artists, some are disabled people. We have a wide range of members in terms of their political and artistic viewpoint.<br /><br /><b>Participant: Arts And Disability</b> - For me the organisation is about arts and disability, but there is scope within for Disability Arts also. My own expression through art would include Disability Art but also goes beyond it too.<br /><br /><b>Linked: </b>- I wouldn't draw a distinction. The issue is one of effectiveness, and contribution to an overall picture.<br /><br /><hr /><b>Participant: </b>I don't have much experience of other organisations but I think what seems to stand apart is its focus on professional development.<br /><br /></body></html>
