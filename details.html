Artlink can create new projects or respond to the request of groups or individuals. The work is, more often than not, delivered directly by Artlink and therefore very personal.<br /><br /><b>Linked: </b>Artlink has been around for a decade or so, there role over the last 2 - 3 years has changed, they are currently re-inventing themselves.

Bamboozle hold onto the notion that they go into the Theatre or another space 'out of school' because of restrictions that a school has. The Haymarket Theatre in Leicester is far better equipped to cater for the needs of Bamboozle with regards technical support such as light &amp; sound. The environment is perfect for interaction with the various groups. For example Bamboozle has recently been told that one particular school who has been attending the workshops for a number of years has had an enormous long term effect on the students with regards confidence. One student had fear of heights and trusting herself, by the end of the project she had actually climbed a number of steps to the top of a ladder. Because of this her confidence has grown and a year on is still happy to go 'that bit further' Another unique part of the way Bamboozle's work is that the students get to mix with one another not only in the theatre but over lunch and working as a team<br /><br /><b>Board: </b>The way in which Sue &amp; Chris engage everybody that takes part in their workshops. Nobody is left out and even in a group with extreme mixed abilities, Bamboozle adapt their work to make sure no-one is left out.

We allow work across a huge range of arts forms to come together as chosen by the people involved. So the fusions of work that take place can be between performance, visual, media based arts and uses of new technology. So instead of us saying ' We are a drama company we do drama you will fit into this' , we actually mould and shape the arts form around what people want to do.<br />The other thing that makes us unique is that all our work is based on experiencing and experimenting at the same time so things that evolve have to be new things. You are not starting from trying to create something within a mould that you have already looked at.<br /><br /><b>Board: </b>First Movement have a unique way of working with people with learning disabilities which is immersive and completely experiential. They use a unique combination of different artforms including new media and live art. It is also different because with their client group they are inclusive and responsive.<br /><br /><b>Linked: </b>The way First Movement work with people with learning disabilities is exemplary, they are always looking for ways to enable people with learning disabilities to express themselves and draw them into the creative work they do. Another strong aspect is the way they are using new and digital technology to enable people to express themselves and to link up with groups from other parts of the region. They are looking to set up a virtual room which is worked on by different groups across the country all working at the same time.<br /><hr /><br /></body></html><?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>

Of course the Arts Exchange makes us different.<br /><br /><b>Board: </b>Unique partly because we are the only arts organisation serving the High Peak, but also because the projects we do are very innovative and the lottery funded photographic and video suite we operate is a valuable resource for the High Peak and surrounding areas. Also unique because of the Arts Exchange and Arts Exchange Plus. Combine these resources and projects with the way the organisation has adapted and evolved from the original concept of arts provision - with hands on arts workers - to become a more enabling, fundraising, administrative organisation providing in a different way. I think the way that we personally know every freelancer that works for us also makes this organisation unique.<br /><br /><b>Linked: </b>High Peak Arts is unique because it has a specific resource centre focussed on the needs of people with disabilities.<br /><br /><b>Participant: </b>I would say the quality of the tutors and the small groups. Its very flexible really, depending upon what you want or need. Some people have workers go into their own homes and have one-to-one tuition, whereas others prefer the social side of small groups and want to get out of the house. The projects you do are tailored for your needs, so that's really unique I guess.<br /><hr /><br /></body></html><?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
