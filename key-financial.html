<h1><a href="index.html">Infoscape</a>: map key, financial</h1>

<h2>Colour</h2>
<p>
range of influence the organisation has:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>green = local</li>
	<li>blue = regional</li>
	<li>red = national</li>
	<li>purple = international</li>
</ul>


<h2>Size</h2>
<p>
Budget amount for an org in one year (scale is logarithmic - &pound;0 is just visible, &pound;1000 is small, &pound;100,000 is fairly big)
</p>


<h2>Shape</h2>
<p>
shapes merge to reflect the degree to which the organisation is disability-led:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>square = fully disability-led</li>
	<li>square/sphere = part disability-led (% indicated by hybrid shape)</li>
	<li>sphere = not disability-led</li>
</ul>


<h2>Axes</h2>
<p>
as viewed when page loads:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>left - right (X axis) = county (coloured): Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, High Peak, Northamptonshire</li>
	<li>top - bottom (Y axis) = time established (1 grid square = 5 years, 0 at bottom)</li>
	<li>front - back (Z axis) = financial year (grid = 1 year, back = previous years, front = 2002/03)</li>
</ul>

<p>
So each view basically contains 3 bits of comparative information...
</p>
<ul>
	<li>View 1: X-Y = County / Time established / Budget</li>
	<li>View 2: Y-Z = Time established / Year / Budget</li>
	<li>View 3: X-Z = County / Year / Budget</li>
</ul>


<h2>Preset example views</h2>

<h3>View 1</h3>
<p>
a county-by-county comparison showing how budget is affected by establishment time for this year (perspective provides an idea of the whole picture for last year and the year before).
</p>

<h3>View 2</h3>
<p>
comparison of how length of establishment affects budget over 3 years (irrespective of county, although this is still visible due to perspective).
